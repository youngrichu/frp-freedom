# Product Requirements Document (PRD): FRP Bypass Tool

## 1. Document Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD outlines the requirements for developing an FRP (Factory Reset Protection) Bypass Tool, a software utility designed to assist users in regaining access to Android devices locked by Google's FRP mechanism after a factory reset. The tool will leverage various technical methods to bypass FRP securely and efficiently, targeting legitimate use cases such as device recovery for owners who have forgotten credentials or inherited second-hand devices. Ethical guidelines will be embedded to prevent misuse, including mandatory user verification steps.

### 1.2 Scope
- **In Scope**: Core bypass functionalities based on exploitation of Android vulnerabilities, system-level manipulations, interface exploits, and hardware-based methods as described in the technical reference.
- **Out of Scope**: Support for iOS devices, physical hardware modifications (e.g., JTAG), or integration with malware distribution platforms. The tool will not support bulk operations for commercial unlocking services to avoid enabling illegal activities.

### 1.3 Version History
- Version 1.0: Initial draft (August 10, 2025)
- Stakeholders: Product Manager, Engineering Lead, Security Expert, Legal Advisor

## 2. Product Overview
### 2.1 Problem Statement
Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature that requires Google account verification after resetting an Android device, preventing unauthorized access. However, legitimate users often face lockouts due to forgotten passwords, device inheritance, or software glitches. Existing tools are fragmented, unreliable, or pose security risks. This tool aims to provide a reliable, user-friendly solution that balances security with accessibility.

### 2.2 Value Proposition
- Enables quick device recovery without data loss beyond the reset.
- Supports a wide range of Android versions (5.0+) and device manufacturers (e.g., Samsung, Google, Huawei).
- Emphasizes ethical use with built-in safeguards to deter theft or unauthorized access.

### 2.3 Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: Individual Android device owners, IT support technicians in small businesses, and repair shops handling legitimate device recoveries.
- **Secondary Users**: Developers and security researchers testing Android vulnerabilities.
- **User Personas**:
  - Persona 1: Tech-savvy individual (e.g., 25-40 years old) who reset their phone and forgot Google credentials.
  - Persona 2: Repair technician managing multiple devices daily, needing efficient batch processing with compliance checks.

### 2.4 Competitive Analysis
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Differentiation |
|------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Tenorshare 4uKey | User-friendly UI, broad device support | Paid-only, limited free trials; occasional failures on newer Android versions | Our tool will be open-source with premium features, focusing on transparent methods and ethical prompts. |
| Dr.Fone - Unlock | Integrated with data recovery | High cost, requires internet; privacy concerns | Offline-capable, with emphasis on vulnerability exploits without data transmission. |
| Open-Source Tools (e.g., FRP Hijacker) | Free, customizable | Outdated, device-specific; no user safeguards | Comprehensive method coverage, regular updates via community, built-in ethical verifications. |

## 3. Features and Requirements
### 3.1 Core Features
The tool will implement bypass methods categorized from the technical reference:

#### 3.1.1 Exploitation of Android Vulnerabilities
- **ADB Access Module**: Automatically detect and enable ADB during setup wizard. Requires USB connection; supports auto-driver installation for Windows/macOS/Linux.
- **Bootloader Exploits**: Scan for known bootloader vulnerabilities (e.g., via fastboot commands) and apply patches for devices like Pixel or Samsung.
- **Custom Recovery Installation**: Guide users to install TWRP or similar recoveries, then use them to mount and edit partitions.

#### 3.1.2 System-Level Manipulation
- **Partition Modification**: Use root access (if gained) to edit /persist or /data partitions where FRP flags reside.
- **Database Manipulation**: Query and modify SQLite databases (e.g., accounts.db) to remove verification entries.
- **Framework Patches**: Temporarily inject patches into framework-res.apk to skip FRP checks during boot.

#### 3.1.3 Interface Exploits
- **Setup Wizard Bypasses**: Exploit talkback or emergency call features to access settings app.
- **Accessibility Service Abuse**: Automate UI clicks via AccessibilityService to navigate out of setup loops.
- **Intent Manipulation**: Craft and send intents (e.g., via ADB) to launch Chrome or Settings directly.

#### 3.1.4 Hardware-Based Methods
- **Download Mode Exploitation**: Support Odin/Heimdall for Samsung or MTK tools for MediaTek devices to flash custom firmware bypassing FRP.
- **Chipset-Specific Exploits**: Modules for Qualcomm (EDL mode) and MediaTek (SP Flash Tool integration), targeting processor vulnerabilities.

### 3.2 User Interface and Experience
- **Desktop Application**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) with a wizard-style UI for step-by-step guidance.
- **Mobile Companion App**: Optional Android app for on-device diagnostics (requires temporary root).
- **Key Screens**:
  - Welcome: Device detection and ethical consent form (e.g., "Confirm device legitimacy with IMEI check").
  - Method Selection: Auto-recommend based on device model/Android version.
  - Progress: Real-time logs with success/failure indicators.
  - Post-Bypass: Recommendations for securing the device (e.g., enable 2FA).

### 3.3 Integration and Compatibility
- **Device Support**: Android 5.0-15.0; major OEMs (Samsung, Google, Xiaomi, etc.).
- **Dependencies**: USB drivers, ADB/fastboot binaries (bundled).
- **APIs**: Optional integration with device databases (e.g., GSMA IMEI check for device verification).

### 3.4 Security and Ethical Features
- **Ownership Verification**: Mandatory IMEI/Serial input with cross-check against public databases; log attempts for auditing.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit to 3 attempts per device per day to prevent abuse.
- **Data Privacy**: No cloud uploads; all operations local. Encrypt logs with user passphrase.
- **Audit Trail**: Generate reports of bypass actions for legal compliance.

## 4. User Stories and Use Cases
### 4.1 User Stories
- As a device owner, I want to connect my phone via USB and select an auto-detected bypass method so I can regain access quickly.
- As a technician, I want to batch-process multiple devices with custom scripts, ensuring each passes ethical checks.
- As a researcher, I want modular access to exploit code for testing, with options to simulate vulnerabilities.

### 4.2 Use Cases
- **Use Case 1: Simple Bypass**
  - Preconditions: Device in FRP lock, USB connected.
  - Steps: Launch tool > Detect device > Choose ADB method > Enable debugging via exploit > Remove FRP flag.
